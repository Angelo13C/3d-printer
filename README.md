I have designed and built a CoreXY 3D printer (all the aspects of the machine: the firmware, a control interface to communicate with the firmware, the electronics and the mechanics). And I've decided to make everything open source!

This is a table of contents:

| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Firmware](firmware)  | The software running on the printer, written in Rust  |
| [Electronics](electronics)  | The electrical board on which the firmware runs, designed in KiCad  |
| Mechanics | The mechanical structure of the printer, designed in Fusion360 (I have not made these files open source yet) |
| [Control interface](control-interface) | An app used to communicate with the firmware of the printer from a desktop computer |

## How it works
[Here I've made a simplified explanation of how a 3D printer works](HOW_A_3D_PRINTER_WORKS.md).

## Contributions
I would be really glad if you could give me some tips on how to improve this project (make a pull request!)
